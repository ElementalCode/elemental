A drag and drop block-based coding environment for front-end web technologies.

Scratch Forums topic: https://scratch.mit.edu/discuss/topic/134554/

## Project Goal
The goal of Elemental is to act as a bridge between [Scratch](http://scratch.mit.edu/) and front-end web technology. Any and all design decisions will focus on teaching how to write clean, easy-to-read, valid front-end code. There should be as little opportunity for error as possible, thus bridging the syntax gap. Users of Elemental should not be expected to continue using Elemental once they become advanced users. Instead, they should be encouraged to convert to text-based code, for a quicker, more powerful, and more extensible coding experience.
